"Budget Buddy"
****************

What is it? 

An app that helps a user to be financially accountable for her spending in several catergories.

How does it work?

* User sets up a budget for eating out, for drinks, shopping for a certain period (week, month, or custom time period).
* Using the Sense360 SDK, when the user enters or exits certain  POI categories (for e.g. restaurants, bars, nightclubs, departmental stores, malls, etc), the app prompts the user in two ways.
(1) If the user has maxed out the budget for spending related to the respective POI category, it sends a cautionary alert reminding the user about her financial status.
(2) If the user has not maxed out, the app prompts to enter the total amount spent and keeps that information to track the user's spending habits.
